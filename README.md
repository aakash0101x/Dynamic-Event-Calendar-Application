# Dynamic Event Calendar Application

A **Dynamic Event Calendar Application** built with React.js to manage and display events on a calendar interface. The app provides a clean UI and intuitive functionality for users to add, edit, and delete events, with data persistence using `localStorage`.

---

## **Features**

### **1. Calendar View**
- Displays a **calendar grid** for the current month.
- Properly aligns dates according to the real-world calendar, including leading and trailing empty cells for weeks that span multiple months.
- **Navigation**: Switch between months using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- **Highlighting**:
  - The current date is visually highlighted in green.
  - The selected date is visually highlighted in blue.

### **2. Event Management**
- **Add Events**:
  - Add events by selecting a specific day on the calendar.
  - Enter details such as:
    - Event name
    - Start time and end time
    - Optional description
    - Event category (e.g., Work, Personal, Others)
- **Edit Events**:
  - Modify details of existing events.
- **Delete Events**:
  - Remove unwanted events from a specific day.

### **3. Event List**
- Displays a list of events for the selected day in a modal.
- Events are color-coded based on their categories (e.g., Work = Blue, Personal = Green, Others = Yellow).

### **4. Data Persistence**
- All events are stored in the browserâ€™s `localStorage`, ensuring data is saved across page reloads.

### **5. Event Search**
- A **search bar** allows users to find events based on keywords.
- Matching events are highlighted, and a list of results is displayed.
- Clicking on a matching event shows its details.

### **6. Export Events**
- Users can download events for the currently displayed month in either **JSON** or **CSV** format.
- Includes event details like date, name, time, and description.
